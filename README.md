# [How do I get set up? ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/GettingStarted)

Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

# [Contribution guidelines ](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/ContributionGuidelines)

Got a script you want added? Then just fork the bitbucket repository and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)
Just ensure 
* The header of the script matches the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)
